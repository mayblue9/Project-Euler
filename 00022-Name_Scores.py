# Name Scores
# Problem 22
#
# Using p022_names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
# a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working
# out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this
# value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a
# name score
# 
# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
# COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the
# 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of
# 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
#
# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
